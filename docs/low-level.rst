Advanced: low-level lambeq
==========================

To understand ``lambeq`` in further depth, it is necessary to familiarise yourself with the low-level :py:mod:`lambeq.backend` module and its :ref:`available classes and methods <backend-api>`. This section provides an overview of the mathematical foundations for interacting directly with the core components of the library. It focuses on low-level operations, offering control and flexibility for advanced use cases, such as constructing :term:`string diagrams <string diagram>` manually without the help of a :term:`parser` and creating your own :term:`functors <functor>`.
