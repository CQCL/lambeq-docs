========================

``lambeq`` offers great flexibility when converting your texts into :term:`circuits <circuit>`, allowing you to customise and fine-tune each step in the process by providing a number of :term:`compositional models <compositional model>`, :term:`rewrite rules <rewrite rule>` and parameterisation schemes known as :term:`ansätze <ansatz (plural: ansätze)>`. This section explains all the necessary details.
