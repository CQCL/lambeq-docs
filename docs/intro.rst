What is lambeq?
===============

``lambeq`` :cite:p:`kartsaklis_2021` is an open-source, modular, extensible high-level Python library for experimental :term:`Quantum Natural Language Processing <quantum NLP (QNLP)>` (QNLP), created by `Quantinuum <https://www.quantinuum.com>`_'s QNLP team. At a high level, the library allows the conversion of any text or sentence to a :term:`quantum circuit`, based on a given :term:`compositional model` and certain parameterisation and choices of :term:`ansätze <ansatz (plural: ansätze)>`, while it also facilitates :ref:`training <sec-training>` for both quantum and classical NLP experiments. The notes for the latest release can be found :ref:`here <sec-release-notes>`.

``lambeq`` is available for Python 3.10 and higher, on Linux, macOS and Windows. To install, type:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lambeq
